What is about ?

The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.


Bullet Points

- The Singleton Pattern ensures you have at most one instance of a class in your application.
- The Singleton Pattern also provides a global access point to that instance.
- Examine your performance and resource constraints and carefully choose an appropriate Singleton implementation for multithreaded applications (and we should consider all applications multithreaded!).
- Be careful if you are using multiple class loaders; this could defeat the Singleton implementation and result in multiple instances.
